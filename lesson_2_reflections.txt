Reflection 1:

"What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?"

Initializing a repository lets you define what files will be tracked. You need to do it so that git will know what files to track.
This does not mean that it is automatically tracking the files though; it just means that is can track the files becaues it now has
a place to put the git information.

Reflection 2:

"How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?"

This is a tougher question for me. I think it offers some value because you can make sure that you are tracking/committing only files that you
intend on committing. Otherwise, junk might be committed that you are using for brief purposes in the directory. It is different from the
working directory because the wd is where you keep your files. The staging area is priming the files for commits. It's the no-man's-land
between the wd and the repo.
