Reflection 1:

"When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?"

If I am a very mobile developer that uses multiple computers or has multiple collaborators, this could be a very
helfpul feature that lets me track files no matter where I am.

Reflection 2:

"Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?"

The "source of truth" might not be on GitHub. The changes I might be making on my local computer might be the ones to keep.
